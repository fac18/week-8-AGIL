## Project

Build a server-rendered full-stack app


.... FAC 18 Yearbook!

### Task

- Build an app using the Express framework
- Use a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data
- Use the retrieved data to populate a Handlebars template for _server-side_ rendering to be displayed on the front-end

### User Stories
As a member of FAC, I would like to: 

- see a gallery of fellow FACsters
- submit a profile with details about myself
- see the details of other FAC friends
- delete my profile if I so choose (GDPR!!)
- click on a link and be directed to the FAC projects gallery

### Goals

âœ… The primary aim of this project is to get comfortable with setting up an Express server and 

âœ… to discover the awesomeness of Handlebars! Spend time considering how to format your layouts, partials and helper functions.

âœ… Include tests and set up code coverage

ðŸ¤ª We expect to see unit tests of pure functions

âœ… integration tests of your server routes

âœ… including tests for errors such as 404

âœ…  You should write tests for your database and use a separate test database and build script

âœ… Use Heroku or a similar service to host the app and the database

âœ… Try to include ES6 syntax on the server

### Schema

### We learnt: 

-  In express this line means you don't need to ref public in the route for your images or css files coming from the html file because it's already done!

``app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "..", "public")));``

- Don't change names of things! We changed some column names part way through (eg rename 'name' in the users table to 'user_name', and then had to go scouting for other instances all across different files
